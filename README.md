# Appointment System

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Extract the archive and put it in the folder you want
- Run `cp .env.example .env` file to copy example file to `.env`
- Then edit your `.env` file with DB credentials and other settings.
- Run `composer install` command
- Run `php artisan migrate --seed` command this will create 5 static user.
- Notice: seed is important, because it will create users for you.
- Run `php artisan key:generate` command.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
- For file/photo fields, run `php artisan storage:link` command.
